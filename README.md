# Odroid N2+ Linux
A repo to house my linux kernel build code and setup instructions. As well as be an affordable web host for my rendered kernels.

# Compatibility
My kernel build(s) are based upon the Ubuntu Server 20.04 available at http://docs.linuxfactory.or.kr/install/prebuilt_image.html . And the kernel fork was sourced from https://github.com/chewitt/linux/tree/amlogic-5.15.y  (which is forked from Torvalds).
